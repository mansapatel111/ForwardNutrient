 After you clone this repo:

 Start with using cd my_repository in your terminal to get to the appropriate folder

 You must start with activating the virtual environment run the following in your terminal:
 source myenv/bin/activate

if the above doesnt work you can try creating your own virtual environment as well using following:
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

Once you see (myenv) at the beginning of your terminal command, you are ready for set up

Start with installing flask, pandas and other dependedncies

so simply just run this in your terminal and wait till it is downloaded: 

pip install flask
pip install pandas

and pip install .... (if it asks you to download anything else)


finally once everything is downloaded and in place, run this:

python pyrun.py

Once it runs successfully, this will point you to a link which should be something like: http://127.0.0.1:5000

This will give you a way to see updates to the website.

You wont have to do this set up everytime, just run python pyrun.py and you can check out what your changes are doing!
